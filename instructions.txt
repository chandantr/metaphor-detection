1. Download the Stanford Parser from http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml#Download and extract it in the same directory.
2. Rename the folder generated in step 1 to "stanford-parser-full".
3. Write the sentences to be tested into the file "input.txt" (each on a new line). Some sentences are already present as an example.
4. Run the script using "python detector.py"
